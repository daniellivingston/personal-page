To "break in" this new website and get used to its capabilities, what better way than to write about my development environment?

This website's colors and 'terminal theme' (at least, as of August 2020) are the exact color scheme of my iTerm 2 terminal:

![]()

* 2020 MacBook Pro 13"
  * 16 GB RAM, 2 GHz i5 CPU

* iTerm 2, zsh, oh-my-zsh
* vim (I'm trying to wean myself off Sublime Text...)
* Hugo
* Netlify
* git + GitHub

* Coffee
* The Rolling Stones
