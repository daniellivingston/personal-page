### About Me

Hi there! I'm Daniel. I was born in the sparse deserts of the southwest 28 years ago, and currently live in Los Alamos, New Mexico.

I specialize in computational geometry and computational (geo)physics.

See [Writing](/writing) for my writings on technology, music, philosophy, and other thoughts. See [Projects](/projects) for a list of projects I'm particularily proud of.
