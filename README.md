### Inspiration

* [Novela (original theme)](https://github.com/forestryio/hugo-theme-novela)

* [Paula Rusu (logo font; Sk-Modernist)](http://paularusu.com/)

### TODO

* Add [`Blog -----`](http://jsfiddle.net/myajouri/pkm5r/)

* Make sure that blog posts accurately mimic [this](https://novela.narative.co/Understanding-the-Gatsby-lifecycle-with-Narative)

* Make `<hr/>` work with dark mode + maybe add a gradient to it
  * There is an `<hr/>` on the blog posts and footer. Copy that style?

* Change the favicon

* Is "copy" really necessary? Replace with "blog"

* Add tooltips to all menu bar items

* Add RSS feed?
